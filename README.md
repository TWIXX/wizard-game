This is a top-down shooter developed in Java.

It is inspired by the Java Game Programming Wizard Course on Youtube. The creator is RealTutsGML. 

In this game I'm building up a first version with the complete Video Guide. Furthermore I'm adding functionalities like 
Multiplayer, a Scoring System, multiple levels and a saving functionality.
